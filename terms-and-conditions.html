      <h3>10.2 Dispute Resolution</h3>
      <p>Please read this Section 10.2 (sometimes referred to herein as this "Arbitration Agreement") carefully. It is part of your contract with Company and affects your rights. It contains procedures for MANDATORY BINDING ARBITRATION AND A CLASS ACTION WAIVER.</p>

      <p><strong>(a) Applicability of Arbitration Agreement</strong><br>
      All claims and disputes (excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable relief as set forth below) in connection with these Terms or the use of any product or service provided by the Company that cannot be resolved informally or in small claims court shall be resolved by binding arbitration on an individual basis under the terms of this Arbitration Agreement.</p>

      <p><strong>(b) Notice Requirement and Informal Dispute Resolution</strong><br>
      Before either party may seek arbitration, the party must first send to the other party a written Notice of Dispute ("Notice") describing the nature and basis of the claim or dispute, and the requested relief. A Notice to the Company should be sent to: hello@selira.ai. After the Notice is received, you and the Company may attempt to resolve the claim or dispute informally. If you and the Company do not resolve the claim or dispute within thirty (30) days after the Notice is received, either party may begin an arbitration proceeding.</p>

      <p><strong>(c) Arbitration Rules</strong><br>
      The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement. The arbitration will be conducted by JAMS, an established alternative dispute resolution provider. Disputes involving claims, counterclaims, or request for relief under $250,000, not inclusive of attorneys' fees and interest, shall be subject to JAMS's most current version of the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and procedures available at http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/; all other disputes shall be subject to JAMS's most current version of the Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures, available at http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-comprehensive-arbitration/.</p>

      <p><strong>(d) Waiver of Jury Trial</strong><br>
      YOU AND COMPANY HEREBY WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY. You and Company are instead electing that all disputes, claims, or requests for relief shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement, except as specified in Section 10.2(a) above.</p>

      <p><strong>(e) Waiver of Class or Other Non-Individualized Relief</strong><br>
      ALL DISPUTES, CLAIMS, AND REQUESTS FOR RELIEF WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS OR COLLECTIVE BASIS, ONLY INDIVIDUAL RELIEF IS AVAILABLE, AND CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER.</p>

      <p><strong>(f) 30-Day Right to Opt Out</strong><br>
      You have the right to opt out of the provisions of this Arbitration Agreement by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to: hello@selira.ai, within thirty (30) days after first becoming subject to this Arbitration Agreement. Your notice must include your name and address, your Company username (if any), the email address you used to set up your Company account (if you have one), and an unequivocal statement that you want to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement.</p>

      <h3>10.4 Electronic Communications</h3>
      <p>The communications between you and Company use electronic means, whether you use the App or Site or send us emails, or whether Company posts notices on the App or Site or communicates with you via email. For contractual purposes, you (a) consent to receive communications from Company in an electronic form; and (b) agree that all terms and conditions, agreements, notices, disclosures, and other communications that Company provides to you electronically satisfy any legal requirement that such communications would satisfy if it were in a hardcopy writing.</p>

      <h3>10.5 Entire Terms</h3>
      <p>These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and us regarding the use of the App and Site. Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms shall not operate as a waiver of such right or provision.
